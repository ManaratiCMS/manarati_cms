Description:
    The app_layout generator creates a basic stylesheet and layout
		which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

    The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
		layout and stylesheet files.

Examples:
    ./script/generate app_layout application

        This will create two files:
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.rhtml
            Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/application.css
